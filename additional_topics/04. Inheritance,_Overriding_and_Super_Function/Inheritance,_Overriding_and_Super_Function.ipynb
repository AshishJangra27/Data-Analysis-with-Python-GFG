        "\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses \"objects\" – data structures consisting of data fields and methods together with their interactions – to design applications and computer programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Principles of OOP:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (a class).\n",
        "*   **Abstraction:** Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.\n",
        "*   **Inheritance:** Allowing new classes to inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes.\n",
        "*   **Polymorphism:** Allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Inheritance** is one of the most powerful concepts in OOP. It allows you to define a new class based on an existing class, inheriting its attributes and methods. This creates a \"is-a\" relationship (e.g., a Dog *is a* Animal).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Analogy:** Think of a \"Vehicle\" as a base concept. A \"Car\" is a type of vehicle, a \"Motorcycle\" is another type, and a \"Truck\" is yet another. Cars, Motorcycles, and Trucks inherit common properties from Vehicle (like having wheels, an engine, a steering mechanism) but also have their own unique characteristics and behaviors."

        "**Best Practices:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Use inheritance when there is a clear \"is-a\" relationship. Avoid using it just for code reuse if there isn't a logical hierarchy (composition might be a better fit in such cases).\n",
        "*   Always use `super().__init__()` in the child class's constructor when the parent class has an `__init__` method.\n",
        "*   When overriding methods, consider if you want to completely replace the parent's behavior or extend it by calling the parent's method using `super()`.\n",
        "*   Be mindful of the Method Resolution Order (MRO), especially in multiple inheritance. Use `.__mro__` or `help()` to understand the order.\n",
        "*   Prefer the simpler `super().method()` syntax in modern Python (3.x).\n",
        "*   Use `super()` consistently in multiple inheritance to ensure cooperative behavior.\n",
